# **Interactive CV**

This is an interactive **React-based CV** that showcases my skills, work experience, and projects in a playful and engaging way. The user controls a character that moves through different sections of the CV, allowing for an interactive experience. The character's progress is tracked as they "hit" sections of the CV, with fun animations and the opportunity to contact me through LinkedIn or email at the end.

## **Features**

- **Interactive character**: Move the character left and right using the arrow keys.
- **Sections**: Explore sections of the CV, including **About Me**, **Work History**, **Education**, and **Skills**.
- **Finish Flag**: Reach the finish flag to see a celebratory message.
- **Contact**: Contact me through **LinkedIn** or **email** once you reach the finish flag.

## **Technologies Used**

- **React**: Used to build the interactive user interface.
